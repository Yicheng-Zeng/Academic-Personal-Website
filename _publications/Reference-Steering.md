State-of-the-art model-based control designs have been shown to be successful in realizing dynamic locomotion behaviors for robotic systems. The precision of the realized behaviors in terms of locomotion performance via fly, hopping, or walking has not yet been well investigated, despite the fact that the difference between the robot model and physical hardware is doomed to produce inaccurate trajectory tracking. To address this inaccuracy, we propose a referencing-steering method to bridge the model-to-real gap by establishing a data-driven input-output (DD-IO) model on top of the existing model-based design. The DD-IO model takes the reference tracking trajectories as the input and the realized tracking trajectory as the output. By utilizing data-driven predictive control, we steer the reference input trajectories online so that the realized output ones match the actual desired ones. We demonstrate our method on the robot PogoX to realize hyper-accurate hopping and flying behaviors in both simulation and hardware. This data-driven reference-steering approach is straightforward to apply to general robotic systems for performance improvement via hyper-accurate trajectory tracking.
